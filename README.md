# Tensorflow Serving API

The goal of this project is to generate `tensorflow serving api` for various programming language supported by protocol bufer, like `go`, `java`, `c++`, `c#` and `python` etc.

This project not only teaches you how to generate tensorflow serving api step by step but also tell you how to use the grpc api for making a serving request.

For golang realted serving api, please read the instruction in `golang` directory.

For python related serving api, please read the instruction in `python` directory.

More language specific serving apis will be coming soon. At the same time, welcome to contribute together.
