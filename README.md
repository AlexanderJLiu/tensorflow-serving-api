# TensorFlow Serving API

The goal of this project is to generate `tensorflow serving api` for various programming language supported by [protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/tutorials) and [grpc](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/), like `go`, `java`, `c++`, `c#` and `python` etc.

This project not only teaches you how to generate tensorflow serving api step by step but also tell you how to use the grpc api for making a serving request.

## Languages Supported

### Golang

For golang realted serving api, please read the [instruction](https://github.com/AlexanderJLiu/tensorflow-serving-api/tree/master/golang) in `golang` directory.

### Python

For python related serving api, please read the [instruction](https://github.com/AlexanderJLiu/tensorflow-serving-api/tree/master/python) in `python` directory.

### Java

For java related serving api, please read the [instruction](https://github.com/AlexanderJLiu/tensorflow-serving-api/tree/master/java) in `java` directory.

More language specific serving apis will be coming soon. At the same time, welcome to contribute together.
